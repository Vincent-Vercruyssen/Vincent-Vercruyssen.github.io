I am a **postdoctoral** researcher at the [DTAI Research Lab](https://wms.cs.kuleuven.be/dtai) of the [KU Leuven](https://www.kuleuven.be/english/kuleuven/index.html). I am building a [spin-off](https://claytech-ai.github.io/) company on automating machine learning pipelines.

My research interests include making Machine Learning and Data Science more interactive. I like to solve real-world problems using the state-of-the-art algorithmic advances in machine learning, data mining, and computer science, if technology is the differentiating factor.
