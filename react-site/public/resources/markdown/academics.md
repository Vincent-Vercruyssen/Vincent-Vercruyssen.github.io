I have [peer reviewed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peer_review) scientific articles for several journals and conferences, such as [AAAI](https://www.aaai.org/Conferences/conferences.php), the [DAMI journal](https://www.springer.com/journal/10618), the [Machine Learning journal](https://www.springer.com/journal/10994), [JAIR](https://www.jair.org/index.php/jair), the [IJCAI](https://www.ijcai.org/) conference, [SIGKDD](https://kdd.org/conferences), and [SIAM SDM](https://www.siam.org/conferences/cm/conference/sdm23). I am also an _editorial board member_ for the [Machine Learning journal](https://www.springer.com/journal/10994/editors). However, a recent article by [Adam Mastroianni](https://experimentalhistory.substack.com/p/the-rise-and-fall-of-peer-review) has some excellent points on the deeper issues behind the current peer review system.

From 2016 to 2021, I was the ombuds of the Master of Artificial Intelligence at the KU Leuven. For several years between 2015 and 2022, I was a teaching assistant for the KU Leuven courses [Databases](https://onderwijsaanbod.kuleuven.be/2022/syllabi/v/e/H0N65AE.htm#activetab=doelstellingen_idm2073792), [Fundamentals of Artificial Intelligence](https://onderwijsaanbod.kuleuven.be/syllabi/e/H02A0AE.htm#activetab=doelstellingen_idp40256), [Artificial Intelligence](https://onderwijsaanbod.kuleuven.be/syllabi/n/H06U1AN.htm#activetab=doelstellingen_idp2990752), and [Data Mining](https://onderwijsaanbod.kuleuven.be/syllabi/e/H02C6AE.htm#activetab=doelstellingen_idp45440).
