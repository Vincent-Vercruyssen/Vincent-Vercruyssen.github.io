As of 2021, I am working on a KU Leuven [spin-off](https://claytech-ai.github.io/) company on time series machine learning and anomaly detection. The project is funded by VLAIO as an innovation mandate.

I compiled a simple and intuitive Python package with some statistical tools for evaluating Machine Learning models. I was inspired by the seminal paper of Demsar (2006) on the 'Statistical comparisons of classifiers over multiple data sets'. Read the paper and find the code below.

Anomaly detection algorithms aim to automatically identify examples in a dataset that are somehow different or abnormal. To this end, I wrote a small Python package that contains several unsupervised and semi-supervised anomaly detection algorithms.
