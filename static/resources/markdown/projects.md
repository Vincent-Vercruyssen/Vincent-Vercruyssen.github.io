I am currently co-founding **[Claytech](https://claytech-ai.github.io/)**, a KU Leuven spin-off company on the automatic construction of machine learning pipelines. My co-founder is [Samuel Kolb](https://www.kuleuven.be/wieiswie/nl/person/00092538).

I maintain a few Python packages containing algorithms that I worked on during my PhD. The **[anomatools](https://github.com/Vincent-Vercruyssen/anomatools)** package contains several unsupervised and semi-supervised _anomaly detection_ algorithms. Anomaly detection algorithms aim to automatically identify examples in a dataset that are somehow different or abnormal. The **[transfertools](https://github.com/Vincent-Vercruyssen/transfertools)** package contains several _transfer learning_ algorithms. Transfer learning aims to reuse learned knowledge across different datasets.

I wrote **[ML-stats](https://github.com/Vincent-Vercruyssen/ML-stats)**, a simple and intuitive Python package with some statistical tools for evaluating Machine Learning models. I was inspired by [Demsar's seminal paper](https://jmlr.org/papers/v7/demsar06a.html): _"Statistical comparisons of classifiers over multiple data sets"_, a highly recommended read!
