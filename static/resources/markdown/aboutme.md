I am passionate about many things, especially science and technology. I obtained two Master of Science degrees, both in [Business Engineering](https://www.uantwerpen.be/en/study/programmes/all-programmes/business-engineering-programmes/master/) and in [Artificial Intelligence](https://www.kuleuven.be/programmes/master-artificial-intelligence). In December 2020, I succesfully defended my doctoral dissertation in computer science. I conducted machine learning research under the supervision of [Professor Jesse Davis](https://people.cs.kuleuven.be/~jesse.davis/) at the [DTAI Research Group](https://wms.cs.kuleuven.be/dtai) at [KU Leuven](https://www.kuleuven.be/english/kuleuven/index.html).
